# MERN Docker Compose Demo

I followed [this tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-your-first-mern-mongodb-express-js-react-js-and-node-js-stack-7e8b20463e66) to get basic app working.

I then containerized the api and clients and created docker-compose to connect them.

Run `make run` from root to build and run containers.
